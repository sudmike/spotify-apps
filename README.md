# Spotify Connected Apps

This repository is a mono-repository containing a backend and multiple frontends, all of which utilize the backend. 
These applications share a common theme as they are all associated with Spotify.

## Applications

There is currently one fully fleshed out application "Mashup". 
The second application is only a concept and there is no timeline for an implementation.

### Mashup
This app generates playlists by combining the most popular songs from multiple artists. The songs are reshuffled regularly to keep things fresh. 

Try it out on [mashup-music.com](https://mashup-music.com)!

### Lighting
This app controls your Philips Hue lights based on the song that is being listened to. The color updates anytime the song changes and is based on the color of the songs cover art.

## Technical information

Each component has its own README.
